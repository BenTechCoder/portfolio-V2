In the words of the great Han Solo (technically Harrison ford, also technically George Lucas since he wrote the script, but that’s not important) “She may not look like much, but she’s got it where it counts”  And that’s the way I want to describe my gear, it’s not the best but it’s good enough.

From my laptop to my earbuds and everything in-between, this is the BenTechCode Everyday carry.

  

  

I want to start at the foundation of my operation; my computer.  I use a 2015 surface pro 4 to produce all videos and most articles for this blog along with all the graphics.  I’m using the Dual Core i5 model along with a grey alcantara type cover.  There’s a lot of nicks and scratches I like to call “battle scars” on this machine.  It gets me where I need to go so to speak but it struggles with small video edits and even specific edits and filters in Luminar and GIMP.  It will get its own video soon so I’ll move on to the next piece of my carry: my tablet.

Those of you who are fans of the blog have already seen the Lenovo Chromebook duet, this little tablet also doubles as a laptop with it’s included kickstand case and keyboard.  It’s like a surface go that runs Chrome OS.  I love this tablet; I use it for most tablet tasks such as reading books, watching movies, and basic web browsing.  The included kickstand and keyboard allow me to get work done whenever I go.  This tablet is amazing and I’m proud to have it as a mainstay of my everyday carry.

Tablets and computers are great, but when you want to listen to something most people take out their earbuds.  I do too, that’s why part of my everyday carry is the Jlab Jbuds air.  Their true wireless earbuds that use Bluetooth to pair with your phone near instantly.  Far from perfect they get the job done but I have a full review coming soon so I digress.

I also carry a 2017 Google pixel 2 in my pocket every day.  Although released in 2017 it got the Android 10 update and will get the Android 11 update.  This phone has aged gracefully, still keeping up with my workload.  It’s camera continues to impress as my main photography camera for almost all blog graphics.  Video could use some work though, but for the price of $150(bought it open box) this phone is hard to beat when you look past the bezels.  The full review is here.

As for my wrist, I use the Fossil sport as my daily watch.  The fossil Sport is packing the latest from Qualcomm along with Wear OS.  I love being able to see and respond to my notifications at a glance.  Custom watch faces help my watch to have more personality than any regular watch.  This watch struggles at times with apps and can be laggy.  Wear OS itself is also prone to bugs.  This watch isn’t perfect, but for $100 this watch is excellent value.

We’ve reached the end of this article with a brief insight. You can do a lot with a little, and that’s enough to keep me going.
