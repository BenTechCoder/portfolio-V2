Animal Crossing: New Horizons has been one the most hyped games of the year.  In the age of quarantine 2020 many have seen the game as a therapy...an escape from the world.  It sure feels that way.  This is the BenTechCode review.

Animal Crossing is a very chill game that allows you to enjoy the island life, cultivating, innovating, and building your paradise.  There is a substory where you need to improve your island to get the famed KK.Slider to come to the island but it's more about the journey than the end.   And that journey is worth its weight in bells.  

You start out as a person who has purchasedthenook.inc Island getaway package, you show up at the airport where Timmy and Tommy(AKA the nooklings) check you in and help you with your name, island shape,etc.When you get to the island,you willarrive with two other villagers, the villagers are randomized so no two persons islands are the same.

Eventually you work your way through tasks such as earning nookmiles (a new form of currency that awards you for achievements) to pay off a debt to Tom Nook.  Or building a bridge to allow new visitors to settle on your Island.  Crafting is an integral part of the game, at first, I thought it was kind of a rip-off until I started playing the game.  Needing to gather materials and make something is an excellent mechanic used in New Horizons. 

  

Unfortunately, it does take time to get the recipes needed to make most tools and furniture but as you inch on in the game your bound to collect most recipes.  Another important part of the game is your Nook Phone were there's a wide variety of apps, most important is the nook miles app that helps you redeem and keep track of your current miles.  I like how even for players who aren't used to the relaxing manner of Animal Crossing you can still point to nook miles as a guide on what to do next.

  

Multiplayer is also delightful being able to share the game with friends and family just enhances the experience.

I don't want to spoil any part of the game, but I've been playing for a week at this point and I've already fallen in love.  From the general relaxation part of the game to Tom Nook's morning announcements I just love the way the game works.

New horizons have had praise for being one of the first Games where the player is more in control of the game.  Building a community from scratch is something that gives you a sense of accomplishment.   There are 1,000 ways to win and almost no ways to lose, that means a lot, it helps you feel good.  Animal crossing is a brilliant masterpiece by Nintendo, helping us feel good when we need it most.  

  

  

Thanks for reading and watching,
