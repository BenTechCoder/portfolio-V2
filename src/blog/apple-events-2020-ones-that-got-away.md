So, with the recent spread of Apple events the rumor mill has just gone bananas, literally a flood of rumors, leaks, and other shenanigan's that have come to define Apple events in 2020.¬† Of course, not all of them are accurate or even true, most of them weren't announced but we still would love to see them.¬† That's the purpose of this post, to collect the broken ashes of the rumors that haven't made it and see the features, devices, accessories, and those "one more things" that got away from the Apple events this year so far.

So, let's get into it.

  

Airpods Studio
--------------

  

I want to start with the rumored and elusive Airpods studio that have gone from release in October to full steam ahead for next year, honestly I'm working off of rumors and the rumor mill as a whole so please don't take anything I say as fact or predictions, let's just have fun with speculations and leave it at that. So, the Airpods studio are the supposed over-ear headphones for the Airpods brand set to bring the best sound quality along with ANC. Much like their Beats cousins the Airpods Studio would have the Apple silicon that allows for quick switching between Apple devices, wether that chip is the existing H1 or a new H2 chip remains to be seen.¬† Another interesting tidbit is the rumor of modularity, meaning that the Airpods studios might be able to switch earpads and iMore has reported possible uses such as different tips for different size ears or specific tips for other tasks such as exercising.¬†

It's not a bad idea, after all different size ear tips are standard on almost all earbuds, why not regular headphones? This reflects the extraordinary and outlandish nature of this year‚Äôs rumor mill. I find concept ideas interesting too but ideas such modularity have always crashed, burned, returned, and then ultimately get nuked off the face of earth and I just have the hardest of times even considering Apple ever doing something so risky but they brought¬†[MagSafe](https://bentechcode.blogspot.com/2020/10/october-apple-event-reaction-homepod.html)¬†back so really anything possible in 2020. As for price there have been rumors stating $350 for a regular model and a $599 model for a premium model that could include materials such as leather and metal, again I have to stress that there's no telling what Apple could do with a device like this but considering that the Airpods pros typically retail for around $250-$300 I wouldn't put it past Apple to charge outrageous but justified prices.

I can't help but think that Apple is betraying the Beats name by taking their bread and butter and labeling it under a different name, Airpods is just more Apple than anything else so I suppose it makes sense.¬† Overall the Airpods studios are a long shot for this year and even next year, I for one really don't care but I feel that people who don't like the sound of Beats but still want an Over-ear version will jump up for joy when these are released.¬† Thanks to iMore for reporting this story along with all the other Apple blogs that work so hard each day, here's a link to their work: https://www.imore.com/airpods-studio.

  

AirTags
-------

Now for another elusive product, the AirTags, found in the open confines of the twitter rumor mill the AirTags Zig and Zag avoiding release at every turn making the hunter very confused and annoyed.¬† Ok, I'll stop it with the David Attenborough voice, but I meant it when I said it left me confused.¬† The AirTags are a tile-like puck that you can slip into or slap onto your most valuable possesions and find them when their lost using the find-my network that is currently used to find iPhone, iPad, and Macs. Using the U1 chips currently found in the HomePod Mini and iPhones you'll be able to locate the AirTags wherever they are with precision especially if their nearby.¬† The disk sized AirTags could shake up the market that has currently been dominated by Tile, there is an ongoing skirmish between Apple and Tile where Tile is basically complaining about the implication AirTags could have on the market. Tile has a point, according to a report from¬†_The Verge_¬†in 2019 there are 1.4 Billion Apple devices worldwide, that's 1.4 billion devices that could work 110% better with AirTags than with Tile, I would say Tile has every reason to be worried.

Price is pretty much unknown, but one could theorize around $30-$50 per Tag, not a bad price considering how often I lose things but still quite expensive for most (also including me üòê). Apple is opening up the Find-My network to combat anti-trust concerns meaning third parties could make comparable device, a bold move from Apple, I won't really comment more about that until we get more information but nonetheless I commend Apple for taking a chance on the ecosystem. Again, these are rumors and could turn out to be pure fiction or worse, overhyped, and overpriced (thinks about Pixel 4 \*gag reflexü§Æ\*).¬† AirTags are something I would love for Android but it's part of this price you pay when you live in the Apple walled garden, AirTags are the unique products that define Apple and their business model. The release remains to be seen, I'm hoping for next year, but then again it could be at the November Apple silicon event, who really knows?¬†¬†

  

### ALL THE APPLE TV'S

The Apple TV...a product that lives a calm life in the Forrest of existing products hanging from the treetops of neglect, predators not very interested in this product leaving it to be alone and enjoy it's time on the market.¬† \*Slaps Self\* Alright I'll stop but the Apple TV is by no means something new and unheard of, it's been a staple of the streaming box for a decade.¬† These rumors range from a casual A12X spec-bump upgrade to an A14X console rocket, I'll entertain both rumors because, why not?

I think the first rumor is the more likely of the two to come true because the current Apple TV 4K runs on an aging A10X that's struggling with new HDR content, it's falling behind cheaper options from Amazon,¬† Roku, and even Google.¬† Apple can't afford to neglect the Apple TV any longer, an A12X would do fine crunching through Apple Arcade and all the HDR+4K you can throw at it. Many also hope that they fix the remote, just do it Apple, listen to the fans and there won't be any pitchforks or torches thrown mentally, figuratively, or literally into the Apple campus (I'm joking obviously).¬† When a streaming stick that retails for about $50-$70 can stand alone and, in some cases, beat a $179-$199 product you know it's time for a refresh.

¬†As for the crazier, longshot, wishful thinking rumor there's a video above that should help explain it from the brilliant mind and channel of Rene Ritchie. The fact that Apple won't let rival cloud gaming services onto iOS could point to a sudo-console being launched in the form of an Apple TV 'Ultra' featuring the very best of iPad or even MacBook silicon to just run the stuffing out of Apple Arcade and handle other games with ease. I find this rumor to be just as outlandish as most, an Apple TV is an Apple TV and not even an A14X could beat an Xbox Series X or PS5, the fact that Apple isn't launching their own cloud streaming service and their not allowing other to board the Apple train means......nothing? Apple needs those streaming services to make this a reality and maybe partnering with Amazon's Luna or some other service could really bring this to life.¬† Apple Arcade alone cannot justify a device like this, Apple has tried and failed in the past, so I really have no faith or hope for this become real.¬† According to the First Law of¬†Vulcan Metaphysics "**Nothing unreal exists**"; as far as I'm concerned most of these rumors may never exists so if you remember that you'll make sure you don't convince yourself of an even that might or might not happen(thank Spock later).¬†

This year has been a whirlwind of rumors and leaks that have just bombarded our poor websites and YouTubers, thank you to the leakers, the analyst's, and the people who donate or comment on their work.¬† If you want to help my channel and Blog, you can use the button below to Buy Me a Coffee and warm my heart along with so many others.
