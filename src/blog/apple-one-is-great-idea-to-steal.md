The September Apple has come and gone and one of the biggest things announced was the new Apple One bundle. The bundle is great, but the idea goes further than the bundle itself. The idea is something that could be stolen, repurposed, remastered, even molded into something better. 

  

  

So, what is Apple one? Apple one is the new Apple bundle that combine a certain number of Apple services and iCloud storage for a monthly price. There are 3 tiers, individual, Family, and premier. So, what do you get in each tier? As you can see in the picture you get Apple music, Apple TV+, and Apple arcade on all the tiers. The middle tier gets you 200GB of iCloud storage and the premier gets you 2TB of iCloud with Apple news and Fitness+ bundled in.

Honestly, Apple music, Arcade, and iCloud storage are the biggest factors in the bundle. TV+ is borderline useless especially considering most people will continue to subscribe to Netflix or Disney+. News+ and Fitness+ are only in the premium package meaning that most people won'tget the premium package making those services redundant as well. If you ask me Fitness+ should be an option instead of TV+ because I know a lot people (ok it's just me) that would rather stop watching TV than get more TV, and Fitness+ looks like something that would get me to start exercising and stop sobbing over the end of Clone wars (get me every time). News+ has a place in some people's lives but not mine, also I've one a many complaint about news so 

  

So really Apple's most valuable services are not in a bundle, their added to things you don't need, Apple is trying to push those services but really, I can't justify the individual plan. For only 5$ more you can get the family plan and share with friends or family.   
  

Really the bundle needs some adjustments because not everyone needs TV+ or Arcade. I love the idea of Apple Music in all the bundles, music services are a need for most people and a bundle that includes that is well worth it.

  

A more customizable bundle would be great, now I don't use Apple products so I would never get this bundle but if I could I would love to replace TV+ with Fitness+ because I would actually use Fitness+ and like a lot of people I just can't afford the premier plan. I also really don't like the iCloud storage options either, you can get 100GB of Google drive for free. The bundle is allowing you to get more for the same price you would pay for one service. The Apple music family plan is 15$, for 5$ you will get a lot more than just the music, especially for kids Apple Arcade is useful but the odd App out is just TV+.

  

So just to recap for Apple people the bundle is great and is an awesome value for people who use the services but what about Android users? This services bundle is one of the greatest ideas to steal and Google has the services to do it. I'll quickly construct a Google parody of the Apple bundle too see my point.

  

Individual:

YouTube music, YouTube TV, 200GB of Google drive.

25$

  

In this version I omitted the Play pass because unlike Apple TV+, YouTube TV is an unbelievably valuable service. I also increased the price because of how expensive YouTube TV is anyway.

  

Family:

Choice of Play pass or Stadia, 

YouTube music, YouTube TV, 1TB of Google drive, YouTube Premium.

35$

  

At this point Google's bundle is more expensive but worth it because you can choose between Stadia and play pass. YouTube is really pushing the bundle at this point. It's also obvious that the Google Bundle will cost much more than the Apple bundle but that's because you're getting more. The choice between stadia and Play pass is also useful for families because families with younger kids will go with play pass while families with teens might be more inclined to stadia. The power of choice giving balance and satisfaction.

Premium:

Play pass, YouTube music, YouTube TV, 2TB of Google drive, YouTube Premium, Choice of Gsuite or Stadia.

45$

  

The power of choice really comes clutch in this situation because you can get Gsuite for busy families or small businesses and stadia for Family's that can afford it. You get the best of Google for a little more than what you get YouTube TV for. Honestly, this hypothetical situation is an exaggerated comparison because Google would charge more just to break even. Google needs to make money and it just can't with the current pricing structure; the prices I've presented are best-case scenario. I also want to clarify that this bundle is aimed at Android users meaning that most of the contents would be useless for Apple users, so bear that in mind when you comment (jk).

  

It is just a creation of what could be and not what is now so for now Apple has the right idea with its bundle. I just hope they know that the idea is so ripe for the taking that other companies may not be able to resist.
