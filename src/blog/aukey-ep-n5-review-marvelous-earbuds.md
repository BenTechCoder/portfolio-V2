### The Aukey EP-N5 review just went live!

Just a little behind the scenes, I filmed all the A-Roll with my Canon Rebel T6 and the B-Roll with my Pixel 2. The Slow-motion really did come in handy! I also record all voice-overs with my trusty Blue snowball, I'll do a review of it soon especially now that I have the ice version of it as well. Hope you all enjoy the video and Buy me a Coffee so I can continue to make videos and content just like this!
