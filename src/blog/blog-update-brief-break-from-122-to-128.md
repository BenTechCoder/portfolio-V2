 Hello everyone! You may be wondering where's my usual Monday post, you also may be wondering why I'm releasing videos on the weekends, so here's my explanation and some other news that you should probably know before you think I may have abandoned the blog.

  

 I've been struggling to keep my weekly article and monthly video quota afloat lately due to school really ramping up during winter. Sometimes I have to decide between blog posts and other more important things happening in my life, that's why I see it fit to have a break from the feed.  The break lasting from 12/2 to 12/8, this gives me a break to work on the many things I have on my plate along with some blog posts and videos in the pipeline. So while I will post something sometime this week I won't sustain the usual feed of 3 articles. 

  

I also want to make clear that I'm not abandoning the blog, instead I'm going to do my best to keep content flowing even during one of the busiest times of the year. The blog and Channel will continue pumping out content, this is just a short break to help me, the author, to cool down and bring the best content I can to my readers.

  

Oh, and one last thing. After the break ends I still might not be able to sustain the 3-post quota so if you only see 1 post a week I'll refer you back to this article for answers. 

Ok that was a lot to cover, even though some new content won't come out this week you can still support the blog and channel by watching my videos, going back into the archive to read old classics from BTC's past. I'll include some links below:
