Hello everyone! Today is a personal post, I wanted to tell everyone that I'll be on break from February 9th to February 17th.  Why you may ask? Well earlier in January my Surface Pro began to have some issues with its screen, surprisingly not the flickering issues experienced by many, rather ghosting and weird lines at the top began to appear, I'm planning a post to say goodbye to my beloved surface pro and to detail some of the issues and how they might have happened.

This is what caused video production to hit a road block, because it’s a heat-related issue I didn't want to risk damaging my device as much as I already did. However, my Duet is serving me well in the interment as a word processor to write this post, soon I'll get a replacement device which I'll unveil in the same tribute to my Surface Pro. 

  

The break is to allow me to setup and receive my new device, and also to give me a break and let me focus on some things I need to get done. Again, just like my last break, I will return, this is not the end of the blog or the channel. I hope everyone has a wonderful day!
