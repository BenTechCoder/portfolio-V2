Sometimes life throws a curveball, other times a truck, and other times a boulder. In my case life has thrown a combination of all three that has led me to make some changes. Since the inception of this blog I have stuck to a weekly posting schedules of articles and videos. The truth is that the blog no longer fits as a weekly part of my life and if I was to continue posting weekly the quality of my posts would continue to plummet. So starting now the blog will be optional much like my YouTube channel. This means I'll aim for monthly but with no guarantees. Thank you everyone who stuck around for this long.Â
