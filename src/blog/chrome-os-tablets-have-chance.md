I recently published my Lenovo Chromebook Duet review but there are some lines I left on the cutting room floor due to time restraints.  This article will reflect my extra thoughts that I simply couldn’t put in the video.  

  

  

  

The first thing I left out is the fact that the duet supports USI styluses.  I could not test this but the team at Chrome Unboxed have and so far the experience is subpar.  With the coming release of more styluses, hopefully I can get a better perspective on the situation.  I also want to mention that the speakers on the Duet are good, unlike its cousin the Lenovo 10e.  There is adequate stereo separation and crisp sound, wish it could get _just_ _a little_ louder, overall speakers very good.  Microphones are adequate but not “_**studio quality” **_like those found on some Apple products and Microsoft surface products.  Also, there’s no way to expand storage, so make sure you really think about whether you want that 64GB or 128GB model (it’s the 128).  

  

  

  

I also need to talk about the cameras, I hope Lenovo or the next chrome tablet (I will never say Chromeblet) improves on the cameras.  My surface pro 4 has a better webcam than my duet and that’s not right.  Obviously that’s all right for me but for people like my grandma who uses her tablet for all her zoom calls and even takes pictures with her tablet (yes I respect those people lol).  She and all the other people who don't want an iPad and are taking a chance on the Duet deserve better cameras I hope Lenovo fixes in the Duet 2.

I’m exited that many people are taking an interest in this tablet.  It’s hard just to get one as it’s been repeatedly sold out at almost every store.  People like my grandma and even my aunt really want the Duet, not because of the price or value.  No, they want the Duet because of their refusal to buy an iPad.  Too many people just don’t want iPads and I’m glad that they have a choice now.  That’s why these tablets are here to stay, people want an alternative and the duet has proved there is demand now it’s time for other manufactures to join in the fun.  Chrome OS tablets have the chance Android tablets never had. The only question is: will they seize this opportunity?

  

  

I hope manufactures such as HP, Asus, and even Samsung follow suit with their own tablets and succeed just like the Duet.  Chrome OS tablets have a chance and I’ve never been so exited.
