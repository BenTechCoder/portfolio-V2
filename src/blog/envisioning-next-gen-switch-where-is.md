So, reports have been swirling about an update to the Nintendo switch with support for 4K and an OLED screen. The Nintendo switch has never been a powerhouse device, although I don't feel like it needs more power, it looks like Nintendo disagrees. In any case an upgrade to the existing switch or the branch of the switch dubbed "pro" is inevitable. So, what are the facts of the matter? Is there any truth in any of these reports? What are my personal hopes and dreams? A separate post for that last one; but for all the questions, here are the answers.

  

  

So, the first part of this report is the screen, the current Switch is using an LCD locked at 720p, and when docked it can scale to 1080p and go to 60FPS (60FPS also available in handheld mode) in some games. On March 3rd, 2021, [Bloomberg](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/6040626338774615204/89798104896758491#) published an article detailing how Nintendo is planning to push Samsung OLED to the Switch. Specifically, a 7-inch 720p panel. OLED is a huge deal for the Switch because it increases detail and color accuracy while being more efficient than LCD, it could also finally bring a glass screen to the switch, with the current plastic screen being prone to scratches (get a glass screen protector as soon as possible). We also have totake into account the 7-inch design, currently we have a 6.2-inch display with thick bezels, a 7-inch display definitely either slims the bezels or enlarges the device, most likely slimmer bezels in the update.

The report also mentioned support for 4K when docked, more on that later. So, can we trust this report? I would consider Bloomberg to be an accurate source and they have a great intelligence network that keeps up with the supply chain, here's a quote from the article.

  

> > "Samsung Display Co. will start mass production of 7-inch, 720p-resolution OLED panels as early as June with an initial monthly target of just under a million units, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. The displays are slated for shipment to assemblers around July, the people said. Representatives for Nintendo and Samsung Display declined to comment."

I think the idea of OLED on the Switch is plausible and very likely to appear on any refresh or new switch released in 2021 or 2022. It makes sense for all the reasons above and the report from Bloomberg gives you even more information, there's some truth in this report and hopefully we get to see it sooner rather than later. 

  

Now for the next part of the rumors we have 4K support, this is when docked of course, Bloomberg continues with a tidbit about 4K. Here's the quote:

  

> The latest model will also come with 4K ultra-high definition graphics when paired with TVs, they said. That could intensify a longstanding complaint of developers, who have struggled with the difference in resolution between handheld and TV modes and now face a bigger gap between the two.

  
The problem with this part of the story is that there is no evidence, motive, or insider information used to support the claim of 4K support on the next Nintendo Switch. There are absolutely no leaks, word from Nintendo, or even news from the supply chain about Nvidia updating the Tegra X1. There's not even a morsel of information if Nintendo is even sticking with the Tegra platform or if their switching to a new Nvidia chipset. I do feel that 4K needs to come soon so that the switch can keep up with the Xbox and PlayStation, and I also feel that Nvidia is working on a new chip for the Switch (or at least an update to the Tegra).

Also, another concern is the price increase, unless Nintendo decides to keep the existing Switch and decrease the price adding 4K to the next Switch might make it soar or park right at the price-point of an Xbox Series X or PS5. Although I wouldn't have concern that the Switch will get bulkier or have heat issues due to 4K because any upgraded silicon will most likely use upscaling instead of actual 4K hardware. The reason the Xbox and PS5 are so big is because they need ventilation cool their AMD CPU's and RDNA GPU's. It's borderline impossible to keep the Switch form-factor and get "real" hardware 4K, instead I (and many other analysts) suspect that they might use the technology Nvidia use in their Shield TV box to upscale the game via Nvidia's AI engine. 

  

However, no matter what way you cut there is just no evidence 4K is coming to the next Switch or to a new "Switch Pro". We have none of the usual telltales of leaks, supply chain movements, or even a rumor. It's all speculation and although it would seem a practical, logical, and inevitable change speculation means nothing and without any type of facts or evidence I simply cannot say with confidence that the Switch will get 4K.

  

  

So now you know why I hate covering rumors....

  

Best,
