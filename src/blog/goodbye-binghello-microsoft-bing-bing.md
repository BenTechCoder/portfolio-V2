Bing is no more, long live Microsoft Bing! So, Microsoft recently released a blog post that changed the branding of its search engine: Bing. The signs have been there since last month, a Microsoft logo instead of Bing logo on some searches, rumors, and so many more signs were just pointing to the inevitable.  

  

  

Bing has gotten a bad rap over the years simply because not enough people use it; search engines need data to predict and search faster. In short search engines need data to be a good search engine, of course you can't just track people across the internet, but having enough users ensures that you don't have to. 

  

Thus, was the problem with Bing, when Google launched the search engine wars Bing just couldn't keep up. Maybe it was Microsoft's reputation that shot them in the foot, or it was just Google being early and good. Either way Bing has just been associated with a bad search experience because of its lack of users, I personally use Bing because I don't like Google's tracking, but most people still use Google just because of the quality and convenience. If you use chrome it's the default, if you use safari on the Mac it's the default, Google has just become the default. 

  

Microsoft has decided to rebrand "Bing" as "Microsoft Bing" to show that they are behind the search engine, also to bring some life to an abandoned platform. Their new icons are great, as you can see above the new Bing icon brings inspiration from the new Edge icon with a smooth paintbrush design to give an iconic logo a sense of modernity. Unlike earlier overhauls of Bing there are two icons on each search page, the "Microsoft Bing" and "Bing" logos.

The new rebrand and icons can't do much to solve Bing's biggest problem, but it can help revitalize the 

platform and make it better for existing users. Like me.
