I've been on a lot of Zoom calls this week calling up my friends, playing Minecraft, telling jokes, and laughing at memes. It was an enjoyable time made possible by Zoom, when I asked them about School starting everyone said that Google meet was what they used to communicate and learn with teachers. Zoom was a pillar of learning during the scramble for homeschooling at the beginning of the pandemic and for some it still is, but Google meet has changed the Game. 

  

  

Even before the pandemic many Schools were Gsuite subscribers using Google classroom to assign homework and students using Docs, Sheets, and Slides to complete their assignments. Why? Because those were the apps that worked best with student's Chromebooks. See the pattern? Google has cornered the EDU market and with remote learning becoming an everyday reality Google has pounced on the opportunity with Google meet.  

  

  

Google meet has been packaged with Gsuite so most schools automatically have access to all premium features in Meet. Google Meet is free anyways, so it has no cost to anyone where areas Zoom has a premium tier for unlimited Meeting time. I also want to talk about how Meet has equally matched Zoom in all the necessary features that you need for good video call.  

  

Zoom can only handle so much traffic and with businesses, EDU, and us using Zoom there's more traffic than ever before. Zoom did conk out for an entire day recently, with videoconferencing being the main interface for communication and collaboration we need it to be rock-solid 24/7. With Google Meet taking most of EDU Zoom has less of a load, this improves reliability while supporting competition and increasing exposure for Google Meet.  

  

  

Children go to class in meet, tell their parents about what they learned, their parents who possibly never knew about meet begin to use a recommend it. Through pure word-of-mouth marketing Google is gaining traction and making it free is ingenious for those who can't affords Zoom pro but need more than 40 minutes. Google Meet is shaping up to be a true competitor to Zoom and Cisco WebEx for mainstream videoconference and it's gaining traction; fast. 

  

  

Be warned Zoom.
