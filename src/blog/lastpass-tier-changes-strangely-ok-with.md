News broke on February 16th that the password manager LastPass was changing policy about its free tier of service. Starting March 16th users would have to choose between using LastPass on their mobile devices (i.e., phones, tablets) or desktop/laptop device (i.e., Chrome extension) with no way to use both on the free tier. This change caused some controversy, and it also made many users switch to competing services. In a lot of ways this is a loss, I admit that I use LastPass free tier, which means I'm going to be affected by this change. However, in a lot of ways this is a change that I'm strangely okay with, it's a change that I wish didn't happen, yet I'm also thankful that it did happen. Let's look at what this means for me and what it means for you.

Having to Choose between your phone or desktop really complicates using the free tier because it forces you to think about your priorities and where you really need your passwords. Of course, on the desktop we use our passwords mostly on the web and on mobile its mostly app authentication. Being stranded without your passwords on your phone is kind of unnerving but having the convenience of autofill on the desktop can also be useful. Here's an example that LastPass supplied to illustrate the change:

  

> > "Sarah is a Free user with Computers as her active device type. She can use LastPass on her laptop, desktop and her dad's laptop (anyone's computer!), but she can't use LastPass on her phone, tablet, or smart watch unless she upgrades to LastPass Premium, which has unlimited device type access."
> 
> > "Steve is a Free user with Mobile Devices as his active device type. He can use LastPass on his iPhone, Android work phone, tablet, and smart watch, but he can't use LastPass on his desktop or laptop unless he upgrades to LastPass Premium, which has unlimited device type access. " - LastPass

  

Now look, LastPass is a relatively inexpensive service with plans starting at $3, and for such a long time their free service was one of the best values in the industry. However, to keep being secure, to keep afloat, to be a business LastPass decided to change that excellent free tier. Right now, LastPass is still secure, it's still premium, it's still stable, and it's still an excellent password manager and all that stays the same after the change.

 Instead of staying free and having to resort to more sinister methods to stay afloat, or just admitting defeat and closing eventually, instead they decided to keep their free service and just nudge existing customers toward a paying tier. I'm okay with the change because it allows for a better, cleaner, and more consumer-friendly business. Hey, it's better than allowing ads on the free version, right? 

  

That's the worst-case scenario that LastPass decided to avoid. 

  

Best,
