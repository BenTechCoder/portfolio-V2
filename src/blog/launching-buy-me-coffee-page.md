This Post is about some blog news...

There comes a time in every blog's life where you must decide, will you or will you not have ads on your blog.  I have made the decision to not have ads on my website. There are a few reasons but first and foremost around them is that ads intrude user experience.  Instead of ads I have decided to launch a _Buy Me a Coffee_ page, here is the link: www.buymeacoffee.com/BenTechCode.  

You will be able to donate $3 and "Buy Me a Coffee" with those $3.  I need to raise money to buy some more camera gear and get materials to upgrade the studio. Those are my goals and I hope this page can help me reach them.  There will be new posts to the page as soon as I can make them.

You can Buy Me a Coffee by activating the widget located on the bottom right of the home page and in the sidebar.
