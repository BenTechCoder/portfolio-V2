the keyboard looks small,, but if you place it over a full size keyboard... it IS full size.  
Use a Bluetooth keyboard, if you don't like the one supplied  
OR.. YouTube "How to use speech to enter text on your Chromebook" this works well  
$49 10in1 USB C HUB,, power IN, Audio IN&OUT, HDMI out 2nd screen, USB A, SD slots, Ethernet,, etc  
add a wireless (or Bluetooth) keyboard & mouse & a 2nd screen & you have a DESK system  
$49 USI pen,, adds Drawing / ART, have you tried ARTrage ( android )

That's actually true! The beauty of the Duet running Chrome OS instead of Android is that you can interface with all those accessories and when you add a USI pen the drawing experience looks to be pretty great although lack of support on the app front for drawing is still an issue. Thanks for the comment!
