Audio seemed a little de-sync'd from the video, but overall good review Ben! One of the earliest hands on previews out for this device. Going to order one now!

Thanks for the feedback! My video editor was lagging really hard so I'm going to fix it soon. Thanks for watching and reading, it means a lot to me.

I came all the way from the YouTube video just to let to know that the Chromebook Duet review was really cool and very matured. Looking forward to seeing some more videos on the same device. Keep it up❤️

Ben-- Have you tried the games Legends of Runeterra, Teamfight Tactics, or Hearthstone?  
  
Would love to know if it can run those games!

Hey Teekey!, yeah I can't exactly test those games, sorry :(  
  
I recommend going to message boards and other forums to find out for sure but if the games are optimized(which most are) or are from stadia, the Duet should handle them just fine.

These reviews are awesome, man. Keep up the good work. The Duet looks to be a great tablet, minus the headphone jack issue and this hdmi resolution limitation:

Thanks for the feedback!, yeah I love the guys at Chrome unboxed they do excellent work.  
  
On the issue of USB-C not doing 1080p and 60 FPS; I specified in my review that I review it solely as a tablet because of that issue. The duet is a marvelous tablet especially considering it will get 8 years of updates.

Although I do want to specify that the duet can output 1080P at 30FPS just not 1080P at 60FPS, I refer you to the article on https://chromeunboxed.com/lenovo-chromebook-duet-extended-display-broken-usb-c/ for more info(thanks Andrew for pointing it out :)
