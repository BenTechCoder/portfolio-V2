There has been rumors of Google planning to make its own Silicon based on the ARM instruction set.  Is it possible? let's get into it. 

  

  

So, what are the benefit's, the dreams, brought about by the thought of google made silicon.  The first and foremost is freedom from Qualcomm, Qualcomm is one of the biggest chip manufactures in the Android world where it has quietly brought the entire ecosystem into a chokehold.  Qualcomm's latest chip the 865 costs 165$, that cost has forced companies like Samsung, Oneplus, and so many more to make phones with prices up 1,500$.  Ouch.  It's not even the chipset that keeps the Ecosystem in a chokehold it's the Modem and connectivity prowess you can only get with Qualcomm.  It's almost the only way to get ok 5G and amazing LTE, so no matter what you must pay the piper.  The way it works is not ok at all, manufactures are looking for alternatives and they need them fast.  Some have resorted to using the lower-end Snapdragon 7-series of chips that are good enough just not the best.  Other chipsets like Exynos simply has not innovated enough to make dent in the Qualcomm hull, let alone their shields.

In Walks the Sherriff 

  

Google can change this situation for the better, making cheaper, good enough chipsets that can expand into different divisions to benefit the company as a whole.  Let's stay at Android for now; the current chipsets are overkill for the average person and even the more demanding user.  Although Google may not have lead against Qualcomm it is possible to build one substantially.  The way Apple has become the silicon monsters they are is by working for Apple and no one else.  They never needed to worry about profit-per-chip or how much they'll sell it for or any of those questions.  They just made the best possible chip they could in the time period and given that time they ascended to become one the greatest chipset dynasty in mobile history.  I'm not saying Google should follow that strategy entirely, I'm saying Google needs to make sure their focus is in making the best chipset possible not the best-selling chipset.  Another point is starting slow, staying at pixel and then slowly but steadily expanding into other divisions.  Google can't afford any chip to be a flop, flops mean failures, failures means broken dreams at google, and broken dreams often lead to cancellation.   

  

  

Another aspect of benefit is better update cycles, the current snapdragons have the power the support Android updates for figurative "eons"; but they don't.  Part of their business model is supporting updates for 1-2 years thereby coaxing the average person to buy new phones and earn Qualcomm more money.  If Google oversaw its own silicon, they could extend updates as far the processor lets them go from 1-3 years to 3-5 years of updates that I know flagship chipsets can achieve. 

  

  

I hope Google can bring this dream to life and finally free Android from the Qualcomm chokehold.  That freedom will bring a better Android and better devices to go with them.
