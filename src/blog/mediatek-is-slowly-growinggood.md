You probably don't know MediaTek, maybe you've heard about their TV chipsets, maybe your Chromebook has a chipset made by MediaTek powering it \*cough, cough\*. Though chances are you've never heard of them I'm here to explain and talk about them, let's get into it.

  

I want to start with the latest news about MediaTek, the company announced an updated version of their Dimensity 1000 chipset platform: the 1000C. This new chipset will power the T-Mobile version of the LG velvet mid-range phone. The Dimensity 1000 is the pinnacle of chipset design for MediaTek and it's the most powerful smartphone chipset that they have ever made but they haven't caught up to the latest and greatest from Qualcomm: the 865. 

  

The Dimensity 1000 is more comparable to the Snapdragon 765, in fact the Dimensity 100 scored an 807 on single core Geekbench, and 3115 on multi-core Geekbench. The 765 Scored a 481 on single-core Geekbench and an 1819 on multi-core Geekbench. The Dimensity 1000 has 68% more power on single-core and 71% more power on multi-core. The Dimensity 1000C is meant to be the successor to the Dimensity 1000 with even more power to take on the much more common 765G. MediaTek is making substantial progress with their chipsets so far especially being able to beat the 765; the current chipsets are between Qualcomms mid-range chipsets and it's flagships. That not a bad place considering that I barely knew their name last year.

Of course, MediaTek doesn't just make smartphone chipsets, they make other chipsets for use in other devices such as tablet's and Chromebook, more on that later. I really wanted to talk about where MediaTek is really excelling, Tv's and smart home appliances. Look at your Tv, smart speaker, and smart display. Chances are those devices are using MediaTek chipsets, and those chips are good. Those processors make it possible to watch video and do video calls on you Lenovo smart display or Google Home Hub Maxx. MediaTek is powering the smart home and that's where most of their revenue and money really comes from. If they keep making chips the smart home dream can stay alive. I'm not exactly an authority on the smart home theme so I'm going to stop talking about that and switch gears to the next scene where MediaTek is growing tablets and Chromebooks. 

  

So, as you know MediaTek makes the Helio P60T, the chip that powers the Lenovo Chromebook Duet. That chip isn't the best but it's still good, that chip and others like it are in other Chromebooks and tablets as well. I'll start with Chromebooks.

  

The Duet is a tablet at hear so I'll leave it for the tablets, but many other Chromebooks use MediaTek, those chips are built on ARM architecture. ARM means three things, Reliable performance, good battery life, and good Android apps.

Of course, there still not the best, MediaTek excels in the budget-midrange space with Gems such as the Duet pioneering the 300$ Chromebook. Let's move on too tablets; do you have a fire tablet? If you're a parent maybe your kids have one, if you're a kid maybe you have one. All the fire tablets use MediaTek chips, ok not the best sales pitch considering the tablets are built to be dirt cheap but it's still something. Again, MediaTek has found a home building ok chips for the ultra-cheap devices that need something to power them. 

  

  

Have you seen a pattern? Dimensity 1000 aside all these chips are made for the budget-midrange section. The chips aren't the best and certainly can't compete with Qualcomm but without them you just would not be able to make those devices that so many people rely on. Qualcomm charges a premium for their brand name but for the budget section who can the manufactures turn to. MediaTek. With my personal experience with the Duet I've seen the P60T being brought to its knees so they're not perfect but it's good enough to be in the Duet. I've tested my workflow on the duet, and not once did it melt, it wasn't lightning, but it wasn't molasses either.  

  

  

I'm glad MediaTek is alive and growing, supplying competition and alternatives in the phone space. Powering the smart home space and making smart speakers such as the Google Home Mini mainstream. Tablets and Chromebooks have been able to keep prices down and performance up using these chips. Keep on rolling MediaTek, I hope one day my phone will be powered by you.
