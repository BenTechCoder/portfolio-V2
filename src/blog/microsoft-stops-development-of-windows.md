Windows 10x development has officially been halted. According to a report from IT publication [Petri](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/6040626338774615204/8803126332345036194#) Microsoft might be shifting its focus to the "Sun Valley" release that should hopefully come in the fall. Just to be official: Microsoft is not cancelling Windows 10x. Windows 10x is simply no longer the focus of Windows 10 development and is no longer planned to ship in 2021. So, what does this mean for the future of Windows? What does it mean for you? Let'stake a look. Quick Note: this article is based on reports, but Microsoft hasn't confirmed nor denied those reports so please take this information with a grain of salt. 

  

  What it means for Windows

  

Windows 10x being put on hold means that we won't getting a new flavor of Windows anytime soon. It also means that Windows 10 is about to get a massive update in the form of Sun valley. I'll go deeper on the future of Windows 10x and its history in a post coming out soon; but for this article I'm going to focus on the future of Windows in general. In all honesty, the Windows 10 that and I are using isn't really getting affected, at least not negatively. Due to Windows 10 being the new focus of the Windows team Windows 10 and Sun valley are going to get better quality features. Microsoft may also bring some of the features we were supposed to see in 10x, such as centered taskbars, streamlined start menu, and new action center + notifications.

It does mean that Windows Core OS, the base behind Windows 10x, won't see any action any time soon with the expectation of the Surface Hub 2x (might also be dead). Windows Core OS seems to have lost its way with the last significant launch item being Windows 10x. I haven't lost hope, and as I'll explain in a future article, Windows 10x still has a purpose. It's just not ready for the present.

Windows is getting more modern thanks to the work that was being done on Windows 10x. Even though we're not getting that streamlined Chrome-OS competitor some people might have wanted I feel updating Windows 10 should be the priority. Windows 10x being put on the backburner is affecting Windows 10 for the better while giving Windows 10x some more time to develop. 

  

What it means for you
---------------------

  

The halted development of Windows 10x has a somewhat more ordinary effect on the average consumer. Windows 10x was entering the domain currently occupied by the iPad and Chromebooks: lightweight computing. For those wanting an alternative to those current options may be disappointed but there's not exactly an outcry for this lighter version of Windows. Many people use Windows for a reason, as a student, developer, blogger, video editor, and gamer I use Windows 10 because it gives me the flexibility to do all these tasks. However most people would be fine with an iPad or Chromebook because their workflows are much simpler. Windows 10x would have to break through that shell and I honestly think there would be too much confusion between the purpose of Windows 10x and normal Windows 10.

For existing Windows 10 users it means a better current OS sooner. Not having to worry about Windows 10x means Microsoft is putting more effort into "Sun Valley" which looks to be a huge upgrade and revitalization of Windows 10. If Windows 10 was still coming current users wouldn't care because you couldn't "upgrade" to Windows 10x. For all intents and purposes Windows 10x is a downgrade when compared with current Windows 10 and that's part of the reason it was supposed to be a specialized OS. Getting a device that shipping with Windows 10x was the only way to run Windows 10x, but we probably won't even get to test that due to it being shelved. 

  

As for foldable and Dual-screen experiences Windows 10x being shelfed means a lot more to consumers. For consumers this means that foldable and dual-screen experiences are going to stay premium and out of reach for a lot longer. Why? It's due to not having a tailored OS. Maybe Microsoft will integrate better support into normal Windows 10, but the fact is that for now consumers aren't going to get their hands on these unique experiences anytime soon. Again, not many people are asking for these devices in the first place so maybe Microsoft was right in shutting down Windows 10x? We'll have to wait and see for the effect it may or may not have on the experimental space.

In conclusion, Windows 10x is possibly never going to see the light of day, and for the most part that's okay. I feel kind of disappointed that we're not getting that sleeker, lightweight, more user-friendly Windows but it also turns out we might still get it anyway. Either way Windows isn't going to burst into flames of the possible shelving of Windows 10x and this might be a way of moving Windows forward. This does mean that consumers won't get another alternative to Chromebooks and iPads in the lightweight computing space but again no one was really asking for this. Hopefully, the ideas from Windows 10x make their way into Windows 10 but we'll just have to wait and see where Microsoft is heading.
