This Tuesday (at time of writing) Nintendo announced a new Switch model dubbed: The Nintendo Switch OLED model. While I can't say much for the name, I can say a bit about this device and what it contrasts with what most want it to be. Nintendo has a system of releasing consoles; the Switch OLED falls right into the system. Incremental upgrades are kind of Nintendo's thing and although the Switch OLED is nice Nintendo is a bit late on so many things more important than an OLED screen (HINT: not 4K). Let's start with the basics of the Switch OLED that will sell for $350 on October 8th. 

  

The basics
----------

  

The Nintendo Switch OLED has its main upgrade in a shiny new 720p 7-inch OLED screen that promises more detail and visibility. Other than that Nintendo hasn't said if there's any other advantages of the OLED screen over LCD in the normal Switch. There's also no new chipset or SoC in the Nintendo Switch OLED.  This means performance is still capped at 720p for handheld and 1080p for docked. The next change surprisingly comes via the dock, we now have an ethernet port built directly into the dock, something that used to be reserved for a USB accessory. Many of my friends prefer Ethernet as having to depend on their sometimes-spotty Wi-Fi so I'mhappy to see ethernet coming to Switch.

Storage is upgraded to 64GB, double the measly 32GB of the normal Switch. Something to note is that there is no upgraded battery from what Nintendo has said so far; OLED draws more power than LCD meaning possibly worse battery life.  Also coming is an upgraded speaker system that is nice to have but abysmally unentertaining.

Nintendo has also fixed the kickstand of the Nintendo Switch with an adjustable, almost Microsoft Surface Pro style, kickstand built into the outer shell. The current kickstand is the worst part of the Switch (sans Joy-con drift of course) and applying a sensible kickstand was an overdue assignment Nintendo just completed with the Switch OLED.  

  

  

My Thoughts
-----------

  

I've always said that if you want an Xbox go grab an Xbox, if you want a PS5 go grab one of those as well, but the moment you try to turn a Switch into something that is not a Switch Nintendo loses. We can't expect for Nintendo to give us a 4K Switch anytime soon when the Switch isn't targeted toward an audience who would appreciate it. A 4K switch is likely in the works but at this point no one really needs a 4K Switch.

The global chip shortage has made the possibility of Nvidia giving Nintendo another chip-let alone a 4K capable chip-near impossible. Nintendo is barely able to secure existing chips for the OLED model and all other switch models. So,I'll cut them some slack for releasing the Switch OLED without any Chipset updates. Honestly, many people were hoping for a Switch Pro and what we got was a Switch+. The Switch OLED is basically an improved Switch with a better kickstand, screen, and dock. 

  

Performance aside, Nintendo seems to be focusing on tabletop/handheld gaming on the Switch OLED. An improved kickstand means than tabletop gaming becomes possible. A larger screen also makes for better tabletop multiplayer as the current screen turns a simple game of Mario Kart turn into chaos. Tabletop was ok in the normal Switch and seems to be getting even better with the Switch OLED. Nintendo is improving what you're interacting with rather than the innards of the device. This leads me to my last thought about the Switch OLED. 

  

However, before I go to my last thought, I wanted to take 3 sentences to address Joy-Con drift. Nintendo should not be pretending like everything is fine when it comes to the Joy-Con drift situation. People are losing the ability to interact with the Switch,making the Switch useless, and obliterating an otherwise unique experience. With any new release of the Switch, we should have at least heard of something of Joy-con drift. An increased warranty, a price reduction, even a plain " So sorry" would have made a difference. Instead, Nintendo is happy to sell us a time bomb that is just waiting to go off at any time; 3 sentencesapparently didn't cut it for my outrage.

My actual last thought is about the way Nintendo is perfecting the Switch like it did the DS, Wii, and Gameboy. The DS wasn'tjust the DS it was also the DSi (personal favorite), DS lite, 3DS, New 2DS, you get the idea. The Nintendo Switch OLED is basically what the 3DS XL was to the 3DS. A bigger screen, better core features, and overall niceness (totally a word). The Switch OLED even comes in new colors, Neon red/blue, and White. 

  

The idea is to slightly change a design to attract certain niches or new buyers to an existing platform. You'd be surprised how many customers spring for a new system just for the color, or screen, or kickstand, whatever tickles their fancy. Nintendo is an expert in small releases that bring in huge profits. The Switch OLED is one of those releases and for so many people this release is exactly what they wanted. As for me, I'll keep waiting.
