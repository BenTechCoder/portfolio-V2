For the past few month's rumors have been swirling that the Galaxy Note series will go away in favor of the Galaxy Z Fold line becoming the new Note and S line grabbing Note Pen support. There have also been some scoops surrounding this story involving a Samsung executive that says otherwise. Let'sinvestigate the rumors and the apparent dispelling of them, and we'll also look into why I'll miss the Note, and why I don't want it to go. There's a lot to cover so let's start with the rumors.

The Rumors
----------

  

There have been so many rumors that I couldn't figure out the original source so instead I decided to look into the most trusted sources I could find and go from there. I'll first post the links and then explain the rumors in a few sentences of plain English, and then I'll explain why some are putting doubt on the original reports.

So,let's break down the rumors. The first ones basically tell us that Samsung might not sell a successor to the Note 20, instead Samsung might add S Pen support to the S series. Then it escalates to all but confirm that the S series will support the S Pen, it also escalates to S Pen support on the Galaxy Z Fold line.

Then there's the anti-rumors, here an unnamed Samsung executive claims that they're still releasing a Note Phone in 2021. This was reported by serious Android blogs, but the sources are obscure themselves, at least to me. For that reason, I'm taking this with a grain of salt and will instead continue with the article as if the rumors are true, but I just want everyone to keep in mind that the Note might survive. We now continue with our regularly scheduled article.

My Thoughts: Farewell old Friend, May the force Be With you
-----------------------------------------------------------

So, what are my thoughts? I'll start with the S21 rumor, the S21 getting Pen support feels like it makes sense, but I just can't wrap my head around it. Why would you take the regular Consumer S series and then complicate it whilst adding to the price tag of an already expensive phone?

Then it hit me: It doesn't cost any extra. Samsung has already pioneered their advances in Pen technology and that allows them to pass it onto the S line with no bump onto price (other than the Snapdragon 888 bump). As for the case speculations I simply can't comment until it arrives, if it does arrive that is. The case could be the best case I've ever seen, or it could be a bulky, complicated, dumpster fire, there's just no way to tell but the idea to me still sounds good. 

  

Then there's the Z fold...where do I start with this? I think this is a great idea, but the glass can'tpossibly be ready, if indenting your finger dented the glass and plastic screens how could a pen constantly being rubbed and pressed against the screen fare any better. However, if Samsung can pull it off it'll be the beginning of a massive leap for foldable phones and screens, if the screen can take the punishment of constant pen input it can be durable enough for mainstream use.

If anything, the Fold series is the perfect form factor for the S Pen, the screen is big enough to be a sketchbook for aspiring artists along with having a front screen that could benefit from the precise touch input from the S Pen. If the Z Fold series does take over for the Note, it deserves it because the Fold series is about pushing the boundaries of a new form-factor and that's exactly what the Note was made for.

Please...Note, Don't Go
-----------------------

The Note is what made the Android Ecosystem what it is now, the Note was the Phone that made everyone realize bigger phones weren't just unique, they were useful. I don't object to the killing of the Note line, but it needs to have more than just an abrupt end. 

  

The Note deserves better, if you want a history of the Note you can check out this excellent piece from Android Central: [https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-eulogy](https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-eulogy)

  

It's unclear if the Note will actually leave but if it does, I will bid it farewell with massive respect and love. Farewell old friend, and may the force be with you.
