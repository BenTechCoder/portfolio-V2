The aftermath of the October Apple event continues, there are more phones to cover, previously I covered the regular iPhone 12s these are the iPhone 12 Pros.

So, let us get started, these flagship iPhones will be priced at $999 and $1099 for the Max.  These prices reflect the premium quality of the phones, the premium attitude of these phones, and premium more aggressive design of the new phones.  The 12 Pro now includes a 6.1-inch display, up from 5.8 on the 11 Pro, and reduced bezels (all screens are OLED XDR quality). The Pro Max has the biggest screen ever to be featured on an iPhone, 6.7 inches, up from 6.5 on the 11 Pro Max, this is really just Apple responding to the massive Android Phones from the likes of OnePlus, Samsung, and other manufactures.  Maybe it's not Apple staying true to the iPhone, I've never used an iPhone, so I don't know how people feel about this, but I feel that Apple is leaving behind its compact phone past.  

For a long time, while the Note and Droid were blazing a path for larger screens, the iPhone was left in its small, compact, cubby hole.  I think this is just a sign of Apple moving with the times, adapting to the latest technology, instead of hanging on to the past.  Also, all iPhones will have Apple's new "ceramic shield" a new screen that can survive more falls.  

I also want to mention the colors, I will not mention the names because their just colors, but the colors are blue, steel, grey, and gold. I honestly can't commit to colors because in my heart I know that I'll just end up buying a leather case no matter what, so for me colors really don't matter but for most people colors are really important to the way they feel about a phone.

The Pros have the new A14 Bionic as well as more RAM, they also launch with 128 storage standards, this is important because so many people must upgrade storage when they buy an iPhone.  That new silicon allows the Pros and the regulars to do some interesting stuff with the cameras.

So, both Pros include a triple camera setup from the 11 Pros, a 12 MP Main with f/1.6 aperture, 12 MP Ultra-wide, and 12 MP 52mm telephoto.  The Pro Max has the same cameras except for a new Telephoto 65mm that can Zoom in 2.5 times and a new Wide that has a f/1.6 aperture.  Across the board Apple is promising better low-light performance and better photos overall.

Apple also included a peek at new "Apple ProRAW", a new format that can help you take advantage of a photo later when editing.  The Verge reports:

"The company says that it’ll offer existing computational photography benefits like its Deep Fusion and Smart HDR along with the flexibility of RAW photos. The format will be available across all four cameras and will let users adjust things like sharpening, color highlights, and more while still taking advantage of Apple’s existing photography enhancements.

“-The Verge

The new Phones can also record HDR video along with 4K at 60FPS, you can also edit the HDR on device.  The fact is that there are no other phones or cameras in this price range that can do HDR video. Honestly, iPhone is overtaking the rest of the industry, it remains to be seen but if my suspicions are correct, I think the iPhone is about to overtake the Pixel.  The thought of that is scary but Google stopped making flagships, stopped using the neural core, stopped using the best processors, they brought this upon themselves. If you dig a hole your bound to fall in, Google just never realized this because everyone else seemed to have their own holes to worry about.

So that is the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max, not in the best detail but I did my best, at least as good as an Android Person could do.

  

Next up, HomePod Mini and MagSafe.
