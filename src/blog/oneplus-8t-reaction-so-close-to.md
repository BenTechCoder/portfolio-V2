With the recent release of the Pixel 5, iPhones 12, and launching my BMC page (https://www.buymeacoffee.com/BenTechCode) I realized I had neglected the OnePlus 8T.  The OnePlus 8T is just as important to the Android world as a Pixel, iPhone, or Galaxy phone but I just had to prioritize. No more, let's dive into my initial thoughts and reactions to the OnePlus 8T.

The OnePlus 8T is the new midrange phone from OnePlus aiming to refine the OnePlus 8 most "T" series phones were refinements to the Flagships not the step-down model. The 8T comes packing a Snapdragon 865 and 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage on the base model.  The display comes in at 6.55-inches running at a smooth 120Hz, OnePlus have some of the best OLED panels in the business and I'm happy to see them continue the tradition. The 120Hz refresh rate is an improvement from the 90Hz from the regular 8, another feature is the always-on display previous phones didn't have this feature so it’s nice to see it. I've never really been crazy for always-on display’s, but many people rely on the feature to get update from the lock screen, a conscious feature for 2020. It also as a pretty reliable in-display fingerprint scanner, a fingerprint scanner is very useful especially in the age of masks in 2020. Combined with the fact that it's a flat display makes this screen one of the best parts of the phone.

The specs matter they really do, no matter what a lot of phones live or die by their specs, the OnePlus 8T make a good first impressions with a solid 865 and a 120Hz display that should keep the phone running smooth for years to come. 

  
Of course, specs alone don't dictate the value of the phone, the Pixel 5 is living proof of this, it's the whole package that carries the phone.  With that in mind let's talk about the cameras or lack-thereof. OnePlus touts its quad-camera setup but there's more than meets the eye, its sporting a 48MP ƒ/1.7 main sensor, a 16MP ƒ/2.2 ultra-wide, a 5MP macro, and 2MP monochrome sensor.  Let's break this down piece by piece (or in this case sensor by sensor), the main sensor is the same Sony IMX586 main sensor as the OnePlus 8 meaning that images will still look crisp, detailed, with excellent HDR according to various review sources.  Unfortunately low-light isn't as great as on phones such as the Pixel 5, iPhone 12, or pretty much any premium Samsung Phone including the [FE](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/6040626338774615204/2452277437210950867).  I do want to let everyone know that the main lens is the best lens on this phone and if you buy this phone the main lens will give you the best picture possible.

The ultra-wide is just ok like most ultra-wide cameras there is a small drop in quality when you switch, this lens zooms out to a 123-degree angle meaning you can still fit a lot in with this lens.  I think ultra-wides are great lenses and I'm impressed how much a difference it makes. Things start to go downhill at this point, the next camera is the macro camera that many have come to just hate, a macro camera is supposed to give an advantage when taking close-ups but many have reported that you get better photos by just using the main lens and walking up close to the subject.

The Macro camera has no purpose other than to fill out the camera bump and so OnePlus could say it has a quad-camera setup.  Speaking of that 4th camera there's also a monochrome sensor to take.... monochrome photos? Honestly, I would rather just use a filter instead of a dedicated sensor that has no meaning or impact on the phone itself. OnePlus repeatedly shoots itself in the foot with these meaningless sensors and more importantly their missing a telephoto, nowadays most camera setups are the classic triple camera array, main, ultra-wide, and telephoto. 

OnePlus just alienated so many people all for the sake of having a "quad-camera" setup. I would rather shave off $50-$20 and have a dual-camera setup, these cameras are one of the reasons OnePlus is going to get its lunch eaten by the likes of the FE and iPhone 12 mini.  I can't justify buying the 8T when phones such as the FE have the same specs, just as good a screen, just as good specs, and better cameras all the way. The OnePlus made a fatal mistake with the cameras that ruin a good phone, OnePlus was so close to a great phone...they just fell short.
