The YouTube channel has been one of the best ways to make reviews, drive traffic, and share content for this blog and although IÂ don'tÂ postÂ often,Â I try my best to make cool videos for everyone to enjoy. Today I have some personal news, we have officially passed 100 subscribers on theÂ BenTechCodeÂ YouTube channel!Â This is a huge milestone that brings some changes to the channel.Â 

  

  

The first change is of course, the link, our new link is youtube.com/bentechcode, a direct and personal link to the channel. This is a huge milestone that allows me to not only direct people to the channel but also makes it easier to share with others!Â Another change is the amount of posting I do, as some of you knowÂ I'mÂ mostly a writer and much more comfortable with a keyboard than with a camera and mic, however videos are special, and I want to continue to make them.Â 

  

Currently,Â it'sÂ just not possible to make a video every week or even every 2 weeks.Â That'sÂ why I wanted to apologize for the sporadic uploads, I just have so much going on I justÂ can'tÂ do it consistently.Â However,Â the channel will continue having uploads over the span of months soÂ it'sÂ not going anywhere, and with your help I can continue to shoot and edit videos to the best of my ability (which reallyÂ isn'tÂ that good to begin withðŸ˜œ).Â 

  

Thank you for subscribing, for reading, and for donating to the buy me a coffee page, it really helps me continue to product content.Â 

  

Best,Â BenTechCoder
