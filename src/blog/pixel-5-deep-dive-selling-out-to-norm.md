The reviews have come, the pundits have spoken, all expect me. I have some thoughts about the Pixel 5 and how it’s still relevant in the tech world, so buckle up, keep your hands in the vehicle at all times, and let's get into it.

The Pixel 5 is a more basic phone from Google, it’s the flagship of this generation of Pixel focused on the midrange and value for the money.  This Pixel has a lot of quirks and they all start at the specs, the processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G with 128GB of internal storage and 8GB of RAM.  Those specs are nonnegotiable, I like that decision because it makes the best specs the only specs, it also removes any upsell your likely to face with an iPhone or Galaxy.  As far as screens go it has a 6-inch 1080x2340 OLED display that runs at a 90Hz refresh rate, it’s also Gorilla glass 6 helping to protect from scratches and drops. 

So, what do the specs mean?  The 765G is an excellent processor for most people and can get good battery life, it's made on the 7nm process meaning higher efficiency and....nothing else? The 765G falls between the 835 and 845 from 2017 and 2018, this means that the Pixel 4 technically runs faster, albeit less efficient, than the Pixel 5. Mind you, the 765G isn't terrible, it’s a decent processor that can handle the basics and light gaming (especially if your using cloud gaming such as Stadia or Xcloud).

Despite that I think Google made a fatal mistake with their choice of price and processor because almost all its competitors have the latest 865, and it's not just that, the 765G has been at $400-$500 phones since it was released.  Phones from the likes of OnePlus, Samsung, and LG can be called better value for the money because they have the 865. Google needed to eat the cost for the greater good of the phone itself, and they just didn't do it. The 765G isn't a dumpster fire that should make you flee from the Pixel 5, it's just a limitation you need to be okay with before you buy.

The screen is just a good screen you shouldn't worry about, the Pixel has struggled with screens before, but Google has found a sweet spot with the Pixel 5.  The 90Hz screen also helps to make scrolling and animations smoother, higher refresh rates really do make the entire experience better. The screen also is pretty modern due to the hole-punch design that has taken Android by storm but unlike most Google still has a front-facing speaker on the Pixel 5, Google has hidden the speaker behind the screen using the phone frame as a resonator, good idea with a "meh" implementation.  The speaker has been reported to be tinny and low quality, thankfully a downward-firing speaker can help carry the sound but don't expect the excellent stereo speakers from older Pixels. 

The build of the device also reflects its status as the flagship of this generation, it has an aluminum back and frame instead of the more common glass that you would see at the flagship level.  The Pixel 5 still has the premium features you would expect such as an IP68 rating and wireless charging, yes, I said wireless charging.  Wireless charging is impossible when you have a metal frame, so Google engineered a section of the frame to be a "bio-resin" I.E plastic, the section of the frame that's plastic has the coil beneath it.  That's how Google was able to achieve wireless charging on a metal frame, honestly, I think it's ingenious, but I also feel like Google just did the easy thing instead of attempting to find a solution.  Overall, I like aluminum because it's more durable than glass and cheaper as well allowing Google to have a premium, durable, and inexpensive phone. Most other phones at price point either have plastic backs or just don't do wireless charging, I think Google made an excellent choice at omitting glass for sake of price while still retaining the features that come with glass.

It's at this point that by law I must talk about the cameras on a Pixel and... what can I say it's a Pixel.  This year Google decided to change it up, last year the Pixel 4 was the first Pixel to have an extra lens, a telephoto. Of course, most complained about not having triple cameras like everyone else but regardless an extra lens was a landmark for the Pixel.  This year Google has dropped the telephoto for an Ultra-Wide-angle lens, many have wondered how an Ultra-Wide would work on a Pixel, now we know. The Ultra-wide is 16MP and opens to 107 degrees, honestly, I am exited but also mad at this camera.  Last year Google gave us all these reasons about why they chose telephoto for the Pixel 4. To just abandon the telephoto for a whole new sensor is unbelievable, besides if they had already mastered a telephoto why not keep it and just add an Ultra-wide.  

There are some Photo improvements and video features so let's get to it.  The Pixel has a _look_ and Google likes to keep the photos in that _look, the look_ is a contrast HDR effect that has defined the Pixel for years. It takes great photos as expected along with Night shots and portraits that are stunning.  There are also some new video modes, 4K at 60FPS, cinematic pan that allows you to do pans akin to movie slides, and active and locked stabilization which basically are OIS modes that either lock onto a subject or smooths the video in motion.  The new features are true godsends for the Pixel because for years it was just terrible at video and was nowhere close to the iPhone, Google is starting to catch up in video and I'm proud of them for finally acknowledging the problems.

There's also portrait lighting, a new software effect that allows you to adjust the light on any photos in the Google photos library, this feature might be coming to older phones but I haven't been able to test it yet.  So far reports say that it works well leading to better lighting after the fact. 

There's always a "but" with the Pixel, with all the algorithms, all the enhancements, all of it is just stalling for time. Whether they like it or not for lasting camera improvements they need to be able to change the sensor, Google's neglect has cost them the camera crown to the iPhone 12.  To improve video they need bigger sensors, no matter what Google continue to trap itself in a bottleneck of their own doing. The Pixel neural core was removed from the Pixel 5 along with the "squeeze" function, the neural core helps to process photos and videos, this phone does not have the flagship processor to handle all the photo processing. One would reason that the Neural core would take the load off the 765 and make processing times faster, but in typical Google fashion, what is logic anyways? The squeeze feature was another loss, many didn't like it but I loved it and it is the main way I access the Google assistant, not even once have swiped along the edges to bring up the Assistant.  Google is destroying a unique feature and shooting themselves in the foot at the same time, and I haven't even talked about 5G or pricing.

So, let's wrap up the deep-dive with pricing and 5G, the Pixel 5 supports both low-band sub-6 and mm wave, I honestly have nothing to say about 5G, so I won't.  I will say that 5G is part of the reason the Pixel 5 and 4a5G are more expensive, 5G is expensive and added a lot.  The Pixel 5 is $699 and as I've said before the Pixel is not a steal at this price, Google needed to eat the costs like Apple has with the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini to stay competitive but when you look at the competition the average consumer isn't going to look for the Pixel, let alone find it in the mountain of phones that have released this year.

The Pixel is for the existing Pixel people that can't let go of the Pixel features or the Pixel camera, and Google still keeps an amazing software experience with call screening and "hold for me" really being useful.  Software isn't enough to justify the price of the hardware, the Pixel 5 is not a failure but it's definitely not a winner.
