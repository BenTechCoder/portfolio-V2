The Pixel 5a is sort-of successor to the Pixel 4a that is basically a 4a5G but better. That sentence did not make sense but the Pixel 5a does. Pixel 5a is a phone that supposed to be simple, and Google delivered on that principle. The 5a is a phone with a clear identity: the best of Pixel at a low price. A-series phones have always been parts-bin phones that pack a punch and the 5a is no different. Let's find out what the 5a is and then talk about why it exists at this price point. 

What the 5a is
--------------

So, let's talk specs starting with the processor. Pixel 5a has a 765G processor, 6GB of RAM, and 128 GB of storage. Reusing the 765g is a smart move when you consider how minimal of an upgrade the Snapdragon 778 is and how Google probably has overstock of those chipsets from the lackluster sales of the Pixel 5. Google is passing on the savings to the customer and themselves. Some also may notice that those are the exact same specs as the Pixel 4a5G; Pixel 5a is only one skew (see above) and one color.

 That color being the same black textured plastic layer used and offered in the 4a, 4a5G, and 5. Google has always done a remarkable job of making plastic feel more premium than it is and Pixel 5a carries on that tradition. Something else to note is that Pixel 5a has the largest battery ever put in the Pixel lineup: 5,000mAh. In turn, many reviewers saw the best battery life ever recorded on a Pixel with most guaranteeing a full day of heavy use and possibly more for light use. The Pixel brand of phones have always struggled with battery life but having a lighter SoC and a bigger battery goes a long way to solve that problem.

What I would call the "killer feature" of Pixel 5a are the cameras. Pixel 5a now comes with two cameras for the first time in A-series history. That array is the classic 12.2-MegaPixel, 16-MegaPixel ultrawide, and 8 Megapixel selfie came with only the main having optical image stabilization. With this array you get stunning photos with night mode, portrait, and video all being identical to that of the Pixel 5 and 4a5G. While I can certainly vouch for photo quality (Pixel 2 Owner), but video continues to be average. Compared to options from Samsung and Motorola Pixel 5a is the only phone that doesn't compromise on camera quality and is specially built for those wanting the best camera phone on a budget.

  

  

Screen size is upgraded from the 4a5G with a 1080p 6.3-inch hole-punch OLED screen. That screen is 60Hz and overall, great but if you want 90Hz or an even bigger screen you'll be better served by the new OnePlus Nord phones or even a Samsung A-series device. Some last tidbits to cover are that the Pixel 5a has a IP67 dust and water resistance which is a first for the A-Series and an upgrade over the 4a5G. So, to conclude this section, the Pixel 5a is a $499 minimalist phone that provides a simple experience at a reasonable price. 

  

  

Why The 5a Exists 
------------------

  

While the 5a is a very boring phone its purpose in the Google ecosystem is still particularly important. The main reason is because Google needs to be consistent with releases of the Pixel A-series. The A-series is the most profitable Pixel line, and it needs yearly maintenance just like every other phone. Refining the A-series with features such as Water resistance, headphone jacks (which was kept by the 5a), better battery life, and extra cameras all improve the user experience regardless of the age of the technology. This is no different than Apple using the guts of the iPhone 11 in the iPhone SE but instead Google is just improving their base 4a5G. With the Pixel 6 coming later this year it's a clever idea to trim the lineup, which Google did by dropping the 4a5G and Pixel 5 and keeping your cheaper but Gooder (totally didn't make up that word) device updated. Most people can't or won't buy a Pixel 6; Pixel 5a is the simple and elegant alternative for the mainstream.

  

Concerns and Conclusion
-----------------------

Some concerns have come to light since the initial release with many feeling uneasy about the future of the 5a. The first concern is that when using the camera and shooting video the "device is too hot" alert pops up within minutes. Some outlets have reported that 4K 60FPS stops after 5-7 minutes of recording even in normal temperatures. This seems to be a software bug because these issues weren't there on the Pixel 5 and 4a5G however the larger 5000mAh battery of the 5a might be the culprit. Whatever the cause Google needs to fix this issue before it starts to become a permanent problem.

Speaking of permanent problem our last concern is that the Pixel 5a doesn't support C-band 5G. The 5a also doesn't support mm Wave 5G but that's not the point. My point is that Google has the hardware to support C-Band 5G that is supposed to roll out in the next years but hasn't activated that hardware. I can't fault Google for possible skepticism over if C-band will be implemented in the networks of the major carriers because the only consistent 5G currently available is the low-band currently found on T-Mobile. However, having the hardware and certification might show that Google will activate the feature once the networks become reality. Google hasn't committed to activating this feature so the future of connectivity on the 5a is a bit up in the air. 

  

In conclusion, the Pixel 5a is the simple mid-range phone that refines the most reliable technology to form a phone that just works. Let's hope Google fixes that 4K bug and the C-band support to fully complete this phone.
