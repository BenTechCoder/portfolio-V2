Qualcomm has recently announced the Snapdragon 4100 chip for smartwatches, specifically Wear OS watches. Unlike itsearlier chips Qualcomm is making progress, and Wear OS needs progress to stay relevant. 

  

The previous processor from Qualcomm simply added a co-processor and nothing more, allow me to quote myself:

"These slowdowns are part of a compromise you must make with Wear OS, although they don’t happen often, they are annoying. The struggles of the processor are only in apps that use the main chipset, notifications and other parts of the watch that are low power are very smooth thanks to co-processors in the 3100. I feel like the slowdowns don’t bother at all, I just learned to ignore them. The real problem lies with Qualcomm not improving their chipsets for Wear OS. The main processor in the 3100 is the same as its predecessor, the 2100. Qualcomm has to improve its processors if it wants to compete with other smartwatches, and the current strides it’s making are not enough for lasting results."- From In defense of Wear OS by BenTechCoder

Yeah, I had some serious anger there but what is important to note is that the 4100 is different. I do want to make clear that both the Galaxy watches and the current Apple watches are a full generation ahead but that doesn't really matter for Wear OS.  Pretty much anything at this point is an Upgrade so I'm happy to take what I can get. Qualcomm has decided to make progress, so here is the list of changes.

The momentous change comes to the main processor (finally!) it has changed the main Processor from an ancient 28nm process to a much more modern 12nm.  It's still not as modern as the latest snapdragon 865 but I'll take anything I get.  Moving away from 28nm is a huge leap forward, that means smaller chip size along with improved efficiency and performance.  That means watches will be faster and have better battery life, two things that Wear OS desperately needs. This processor can also run at 1.7 GHz's which means it can ramp up power when needed.  The GPU has also improved from Adreno 304 to Adreno A504 for up to 2 and a half times the power.  

Qualcomm is also adding in an improved version of the co-processor which will allow for better always-on and haptics among other things.  Qualcomm is pushing two versions of the 4100 one with the enhanced co-processor and one with the regular co-processor, I suppose that the\+ version of the 4100 will be more expensive than its counterpart.  

  

Those are the complete changes, but will it work, can manufactures put this chip in watches?  I sure hope so because this chip is real progress for Wear OS, and progress means hope.  Hope is a chance for success, all we need is a chance and Qualcomm finally gave Wear OS a chance.
