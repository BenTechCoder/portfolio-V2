I just saw the WWDC Keynote live and I just have a ton of thoughts and reactions to the new releases and announcements. I'll only cover the parts that interested me (so no Watch OS, TV OS, or iPad OS; sorry).  So,let’s get into it.

  

iOS:

iOS 14 introduces some great updates and new features this year, first and foremost I want to talk about the widgets.  The new widgets look slick and somewhat remind me of Windows Phone.  The Smart stack is also a nifty adjustable "smart stack" that changes the widgets based on time of day and other factors.  Android could use that kind of adjustable widget, overall apple finally fixed widgets on the iPhone.  They also added their version of the app drawer that apple dubbed "the app library" where you can find all your apps stored in folders along with one folder dedicated to predicted apps(apps that the phone predicts you will use next). 

  

 All those features seem taken straight out of the Android playbook.  The way you access the app library is reminiscent of Windows phone; the way you access the app library is by swiping through the pages of the home screen until the last one.  Apple allows you to remove pages of the home screen to access the app library quicker, on Windows Phone you accessed their version of the app drawer by swiping to the right to reveal a list view of all installed apps.  Overall, there were some welcome improvements that help iOS improve.

MacOS:

  

WWDC brought about the release of MacOS Big Sur.  Apple was able to change the design of and looks of MacOS adding the control center and widgets to the bar on the top.

They also redesigned the icons and rebuilt most of their apps with Catalyst and perfected all their apps for their new ARM processors.  They also announced a Monumental ARM transition, they were able to bring Adobe onboard to release Photoshop and Lightroom optimized for ARM.  Even Final cut pro and Logic pro will be optimized for ARM; they also will support all iOS apps because they share the same architecture; a move made by Chrome OS years ago.  Overall,I think Apple made the right move to optimizeall ofits apps for ARM, Microsoft has a lot to learn from Apple but that is a separate article.
