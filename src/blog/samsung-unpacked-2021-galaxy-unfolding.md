Samsung unpacked has just wrapped up and a ton of hardware was announced. Samsung is extending an olive branch to the mainstream with the introduction of of the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3. We also have some nice accessories with the Galaxy Watch 4 and 4 Classic along with the refreshed Galaxy Buds. Interestingly enough just like how many associate Fast & Furious  with the word "family" (check the memes) Samsung unpacked seemed to be centered around the word "**YOU**_"_**.  **Every announcement seemed to be flanked with some mention of the word "You" and how it will do something for "You". I don't know about "You" but I feel that Samsung's supposed focus on "You" is a bit farfetched in all the devices for Unpacked 2021. Still, Samsung managed to bring a lot to the table for "You". Let's take a look. 

  

Z Fold 3
--------

The Samsung Galaxy fold is back with a better screen, S Pen support, an under-display camera, and water resistance. We also have the Z Flip 3 that has a massively improved cover screen, water resistance, and newer screen and cameras. Let's start with the Fold. The Fold 3's screens have both been bumped up to 120Hz with the outer screen using switching to gorilla glass victus and the inner screen supposedly being 80% stronger. The inner 7.6-inch display also has an under-display selfie camera that is the first of its kind in foldables.

 Samsung covered the hole-punch selfie camera of the inner display with less Pixel than the rest of the screen meaning that if you look for that spot you can easily find it. This selfie camera is 4 megapixels and Samsung insists that this camera is made for video calls while they expect you to use the outer-display selfie cam or even the primary cameras for your normal selfies. I think Samsung made the right call to export this feature to the fold line. This feature isn't ready for the S line or the Flip line. The Fold 3 has enough extra cameras to cover the costs and its audience will most likely appreciate the uninterrupted canvass. I'm not making excuses for Samsung; they put an awful webcam in the inner display, but they had to start at the only device where it wouldn't be too big a hassle.

The Fold 3 also includes a feature that runs deep in Samsung's blood: S-Pen support. Now, this is a special version of the S Pen dubbed the S Pen Fold. The reason you need this specific type of S Pen is because any normal scratch could be lethal to the Fold 3. The S Pen Fold has a retracting tip that retracts when too much pressure is placed on the screen and has a rounder tip that also helps to protect that stronger but still fragile screen of the Fold 3. The protective film that goes over the ultra-thin glass of the Fold 3 is now made of PET a material Samsung hope to fare better than the plastic used in the Fold 2. We finally are seeing the Fold take its place as the successor to the Note at least in this slightly scuddled form. Serious Artists won't even touch this device but casual not takers might be delighted to make better use of the inner screen. I wish Samsung had found a way to make the S Pen included and embedded in the chassis of this device, but I suppose that will have to wait for Fold 4.

Some last specs include the 888 being used in the Fold 3, 12GB of RAM, and up to 512GB of storage. The Z Fold 3 also brings on IPX8 water resistance that is another first for the foldable market. This IP rating means you can submerge the Fold 3 for up to 30 minutes and makes small splashes less of a worry for this device. There's dusk resistance though so beaches and dry areas are still a problem and limitation for the Fold 3. Samsung tried hard last year for improved dust resistance (although it wasn'tperfect) getting true water resistance this year goes a long way to better protection for foldables. 

  

Cameras have stayed the same as the Fold 3 borrows its primary camera array from the Z Fold 2. This is a standard 12 MP array of Wide, Ultra-Wide, and 2x telephoto. Considering that the price still starts at $1,800; at least $200 off the Fold is something to show for the cameras. Samsung is trying to make the case that the Z Fold 3 isn't the disaster the original Fold was. Trying to make the design tougher is exactly what Samsung needed to do and adding an S Pen was the perfect feature to test it. I think The Z Fold 3 hold a lot of question that will need to be settled throughout the year of 2021 and 2022 as we don't really know if the wear and tear of an S Pen will kill the display after a few months. We also don't know if it will suffer the display issues the Fold 2 has encountered in the past months.

Samsung is also kind of blindsiding this phone with a smaller 4400mAh than last year's 4500mAh battery. The battery life of the Fold 2 wasn't stellar and the extra 120Hz and of the cover screen only adds to the power draw. Either the Snapdragon 888 is going to work a miracle, or the Fold 3 is going to be a Battery dumpster fire and I'm leaning toward the ladder. The Fold 3 is a mixed bag of inconvenience, niche, and confusion that takes an incredibly unique person to buy. The Fold 3 should be the phone without compromises and right now there's a few too many for the Fold 3 to really be the phone it meant to be. 

  

  

Z Flip 3
--------

  

The Z Flip 3 is the much more conservative of the two phones while also being the most minimal. Looking at the design one could make the case that this phone is a pixel thanks to its beautiful two-tone design that blends the best of the colors into one phone. This is of course a normal glass sandwich that is also 30 percent stronger on the hinge side and an unknown (but still grand) stronger thank to gorilla glass victus on the outside. On the inside we have a 6.7-inch 120Hz screen that is also coated in the new PET screen protector as the Fold 3 that feels more like glass and protects about less than so. Overall solid for the Flip 3 and even better is the Fixing of one of the biggest gripes of the original Flip and Flip 2: the outer display,

This 1.9-inch outer display seems small because it still is at this point anything was better than the pill-sized display of the earlier generation. This display can now display the quick setting menu and your full complement of swappable notifications. Another neat feature are the widgets you can add such as weather, clock, and music controls. The outer display is at last useful at this point for checking smaller things you don't really need the larger display for, and this makes the phone less of a hassle to use. Samsung also claims you can use it to frame up selfies with the main camera and I think that this is them thinking of "You" as they so eloquently emphasized every 5 seconds. You are getting more use out of this outer display, and You are getting better selfies with the main cameras. The razer still takes the cake for the best outer screen, but the Fold 3 catches up in the most important ways.

Screens aside you have the same IPX6 water resistance as the Fold 3 but sadly no dust resistance. It also comes with a Snapdragon 888, 8GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of storage. A bit sad to see it start at 128 and no SD card support as well. Cameras are the same 12MP Main and Ultra-wide while the interior is a normal 10MP selfie cam. Most moan and growl about this lack of cameras while the iPhone 12 gets away with about the same camera specs. This is a Z Flip 3 phone not the S21 Ultra Pro Maxx whatever you want to compare it to. As the entry-level phone shouldn't we be willing to expect entry-level cameras?

I'll admit that Samsung should probably do better image processing to make up for the lackluster hardware (much like how Google and Apple do) but software on the Z Flip is still a high point so far. Samsung now mentions you can prop up the Z Flip and let the Ultra-Wide frame up the shot. This is remarkably similar to the center stage feature introduced on the 2021 iPad Pro as it adjusts the shot if a new human enters the fray, Now Flex mode also lets you see more at the bottom while keeping the content up top; it's still rudimentary but if app and web developers keep adding features, Ican't see how thisisn't a plus.

The specs of the Z Flip 3 aren't impressive, and most flagship phones do better but that's part of the novelty. You may notice I have significantly less to say about the Flip 3 and that's by design. The Flip 3 is made to be the entry-level phone and the -dare I say it- average consumer phone. Samsung made a point to focus on how it matches up with the Galaxy watch 4's wallpaper, how you can match colors, with the clear message of "this is a fashion statement phone". This makes sense from a marketing standpoint and gives room to an audience that may have never thought of the Z Flip 3 as an option. Starting at $999.99 this is the most accessible foldable ever made and Samsung kept it simple to reach this price point. This is a Folding base S20-S21 quality phone that is appealing to the mainstream who want a more minimal or just smaller phone. The iPhone mini is an example of the smaller form-factor having issues and the Flip 3 gives you that smaller form for a bit more bulk and price.

  

Both phones go are in preorders now. My next post will cover the Galaxy Buds 2 and the galaxy Watch 4 so please stay ready to receive that post. 

Best, BenTechCoder
