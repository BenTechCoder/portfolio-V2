So After a short break I'm back at it with unpacked part 2. Let's get into it.

  

I'm going to start with the most important product that could save lives: The Galaxy watch 3. Samsung has finally released the long-awaited sequel to the Galaxy watch, the Galaxy watch 3. The main headline features are a slew of new health sensors and two wrist sizes 45mm (about half the length of the long edge of a credit card) and 41mm with multiple colors including the elusive "mystic bronze" that has covered almost all the devices announced at the show. I mean I get that Samsung wants a reliable color scheme but it's just a color not some monumental change to a product. Anyways....I'm not going to go deep into the watch as this is just a reaction, but ECG/EKG sensor has finally made it to an Android Smartwatch. ECG has been an Apple Watch Exclusive for months forcing some who need those ECG sensors to buy an Apple watch and iPhone to go with it. The chipset hasn't been updated since the Watch active 2, although there have not been any updates it still performs great. Samsung made an excellent processor that they're just going to ride out, but when we look at the plight of Wear OS and Qualcomm, I think Samsung has been warned. 

  

  

Ok let's talk beans, specifically the Galaxy beans that are called the Galaxy buds live. Before I get into the form factor, sound, or anything else I just want to talk about the huge marketing miss Samsung took when they didn't name them "beans". They look like beans and the "mystic bronze" color does make them look even more like kidney beans; and it's not just that. Calling them Beans could be a call to the unique form factor and a unique name to go with it; "they're not Buds their Beans!" would be a great slogan lol. Samsung was considering calling them beans, we know this thanks to reference to beans in the product landing page (first mentioned on the Vergecast by Dieter bohn. The actual beans have an open-ear design like the Airpods, to make up for that design Samsung has included Active noise cancelation. The noise cancelation is wasted on these beans because the open-ear design let's in so much noise that the ANC only cancels out the minor noises such as a loud air conditioner or water running. It's better than nothing, I guess. The case is also precariously small but thick, it looks bigger than it is in promo videos, so that misguides people just a little bit. Samsung has made a new form factor earbud that I cannot wait to see improve. 

  

  

The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ has also made its debut. This is the sequel to last year's tab S6, with similar specs with the main difference being that the S7 has a 12.4inch screen and 11inch display options. Speaking of display that display is capital-A Amazing, their all Super AMOLED panels at 120Hz. That makes the tablet screen feel smother and brighter, it certainly demolishes the display on most our laptops and even that of the iPad Pro. Specs are also abundant with your usual options of RAM and storage along with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+ Octa Core (3.09GHz + 2.4GHz + 1.8GHz) chipset. Certain to say the Screen and Specs are the stars of the show but the software you actually interact with kills both. This tablet is running Android with the dex desktop environment splattered on it. Needless to say, it sucks, Android just wasn't made to be a desktop environment with windowed apps and a pointer system. Most apps aren't optimized for Dex and most just don't work. The Tab S7 has a better screen and comparable specs to the iPad Pro but for the first time I can recall I would choose an iPad for the software. If Samsung had relinquished control to Chrome OS not only could the Tab S7 do more with its specs and screen it could compete as the Pixel Slate that never was. Samsung really needs to be humble and admit almost no one would buy this tablet save for the S-pen, and not even then.
