It's time to go ahead and talk about the other two major announcements from the spring Apple event: AirTag and Apple TV 4K. I had previously covered the AirTags in a post basically saying how it was amazing how long Apple had delayed these bite-sized devices. I also wrote about the new Apple TV 4K, mostly about the rumors of the device we have today, and an outlandish dream device that some were hoping for. These two devices have been rumored and expected for so long and now that wait is finally over, we have some points to cover. Let's get started. 

AirTag
------

AirTags are tile-like trackers that are made to help you find your lost device. Maybe your keys, maybe your bike, or maybe your car. The form-factor is a compact little disk that seems thin enough to fit in your wallet (still not sure if it can) but small enough to fit on a keychain. It has IP67 water resistance, a built-in speaker that uses the shell as a vibration engine to make sound, and an accelerometer. Other hardware information includes a user replaceable battery (Apple claims a year of battery life), accessories like a keychain loop (special leather colors as seen in the post art), and there's a free engraving program right now that allows for a short text field or emoji to be engraved into your AirTag when bought from Apple. Some coverage and reviews have already been done and many have commented on how easily AirTags scratch; most people won't really care since you won't really be interacting with the AirTags often. Still sad (and sus) but I suppose glitches of a first-gen product.

    To track the AirTag Apple is using their "find my" network, Bluetooth LE, and UWB (ultra-wide-band frequencies enabled by the U1 chip inside it). Let's break each of these items down one by one. The "find my" is a network that has previously helped you find your lost Apple devices in three main ways: sound, map view, and "lost mode" which can alert nearby people of the devices owner's information so it can be returned later. The Find My network uses other Apple products that have opted-in to bounce Bluetooth pings for lost devices and keeps the process encrypted so that no one can see the location of a device that has helped find a lost device. 

AirTags tap into this network and basically work as any other device on the Find My network that you, the registered owner of the tag, can use to find the item that the AirTag is attached to. Bluetooth LE is "Bluetooth low-energy" is a technology used to help the AirTags get found in the Find My network while staying efficient enough to not lose battery. UWB is a technology powered by the U1 chip inside the latest iPhone 12's and in the AirTag, this is a feature called "precision finding"  that helps you to find the AirTag when in close range (think keys stuck in couch) and guides you within the app with an arrow and sound.

The true power of the AirTags lie in the Find My network as there are so many devices registered to Find My in the Apple ecosystem. As reviews have shown, the network is reliable, and the tags work as seamlessly as the competition. There are some privacy concerns, and the threat of tracking is very real, but Apple's encryption and safety measures seem to be enough. It even allows Android phones that find an AirTag to tap it with NFC and check the owner's information in hopes of a return. Apple seems to have made a useful product that is adding extra spice to the tracker market of Tile, Galaxy SmartTags, and now AirTags. Pricing starts at $29 for one and $99 for a four-pack with orders starting April 30th.

Apple TV 4K
-----------

After nearly 4 years of constant ridicule, complaints, and jokes Apple has released a brand-new Apple TV 4K. The main changes to the Apple TV 4K are the new A12 bionic chip, Siri remote (can be bought separately), and connectivity improvements. The new A12 gives this new Apple TV the ability to play and accept Airplay videos in higher frame rates (think 120FPS) in several HDR color formats such as Dolby vision and audio such as Dolby Atmos. It also allows for higher-framerates and overall performance in Apple Arcade games; not sure which ones but I suppose future proofing makes sense considering it might be another 4 years before another model releases. I feel like an A13 or A14 might have been in better taste but using the A12 is a bit more efficient. The base model iPad uses the A12 and when you consider the chip shortages currently taking place it makes sense for Apple to subtly increase production of the A12 to manufacture in both the iPad and Apple TV.

The A12 also enables a color calibration feature that pairs your iPhone to the Apple TV 4K and uses the sensor in your iPhone's (this feature supports only iPhone X or newer) FaceID camera to tune the colors on your TV. Manual color calibration isawfully hard and often left to professionals. This new featurewon't replace those professionals, but it will go a long way for most consumers who have access to this feature. However,it's still yet to be seen how effective it is so be warned before you invest. 

  

The remote is the next improvement and the feature that got the most attention. I suppose after 4 years of having the worst remote in the streaming area, being challenged several times by Amazon (opinion), Apple finally redesigned the Siri remote. It places the Siri button on the side, adds a power button, and changes the flat trackpad to a directional trackpad that still supports gestures. In fact, there's a new gesture that allows you to use the circular pad of the remote as a click-wheel to rewind shows. This silver remote is one of the brightest features of this new Apple TV and might be more popular as a stand-alone product.

Lat but not least are the connectivity improvements. This new Apple TV 4K now supports WI-FI 6 for future proofing and integration into modern routers along with better HomeKit integration and support. It's yet to be seen if Apple will expand the HomeKit feature set for the Apple TV 4K but it would be nice to put some of the power of the A12 into the smart home. It also supports "Thread" a protocol that is slowly gaining traction and cross-platform support. At the end of the line, we also have an HDMI 2.1 port that it going to make so many people happy. HDMI 2.1 is allowing for higher framerates and HDR content on different TV's; it'sfutureproofing for the Apple TV.  For more on HDMI check out this episode of the VergeCast embedded below.

The Apple TV seems like it can do more and be more that what the device is today. Just look at the Nvidia Shield, people use it as a plex server, a smart home hub, and so much more. Android being unlocked means people can do more than just watch TV and play games with the Nvidia Shield. Even looking at the storage choice on the Apple TV 4K I don't see the point, 32GB for $179, and $199 for 64GB. What are you going to do with that storage? Not even avid Apple Arcade gamers are going to use that storage to its fullest ability. In any case for most people a simple Roku stick or Chromecast with Google TV because even paying $179 is not a terrific value considering most other options do 80% of the experience for so much less. The new Apple TV 4K will be available for preorder April 30th.
