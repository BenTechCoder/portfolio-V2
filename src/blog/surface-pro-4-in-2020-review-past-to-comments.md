Thankfully, no; although there was a issue with some drivers that caused my WiFi to fail but I fixed that.

Greetings cooldip! Yeah so I dont have that model exaxctly I have the i5 6th gen with 8gb or RAM and 256 GB of SSD. I use GIMP not Photoshop so I really couldn't tell you also I don't do "serious" photoshop work like layers or anything like that all that often. In the work I do do it runs marginally smooth but there are some stutters from time to time when applying filters and some color works. I also want to mention that Luminar and most likely Lightroom run like trash so I wouldn't count on Photoshop running that good. I think GIMP runs so smoothly only because of it's lightweight nature. I would suggest a more recent Surface or a true bred laptop for creative work. If you want the best bang for the buck I do suggest looking into Surface Laptop or really any laptop with AMD's new 4th Gen Ryzen that are just smoking intel right now.
