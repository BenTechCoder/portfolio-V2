The Pixel 4a was a source of excitement for so many people looking for the next great pixel phone. It was slated to release in March/April, then the pandemic hit, then they said June, July, and now we have had to wait until today August 3rd. The Pixel 4a has been rumored, rumored, and then rumored some more without any conformation or even tease from Google itself. I'm glad Google is finally releasing this phone but it's too little too late.

  

  

The Pixel 4a has been on the sidelines as brand-new stars have emerged in the budget space like the iPhone SE 2 and the OnePlus Nord. Those phones completely blow the 4a out of the water in value for price, although the camera prowess of the 4a does give it an edge. The iPhone SE simply has the Raw power of the A13 to be of better value for power users and those who want smaller phones, and the OnePlus Nord is so well balanced in every department I don't think the 4a will do well in Europe. Here in the US the OnePlus Nord isn't available yet so I will go ahead and bag that topic for another article and just focus on the 4a. 

  

The iPhone SE took the world by storm in late April and just never looked back; capturing the hearts of Journalists, youtubers, and so many, just so many people who loved their home button and never wanted it taken away from them ever again. The 4a was slated to be the Android response bearing a more modern design and better cameras at the expense of performance due to the inferior Snapdragon 730 powering the 4a. There would be great options for both sides to choose from and be happy. Until it just did not happen, with the cancelation of Google I/O the 4a was delayed, a monumental but not fatal blow. Scheduled for June, then July at the Android beta show. It's been delayed until today August 3rd. This actually makes it coincide with the upcoming Pixel 5.

The Pixel 5 itself is rumored to be a midrange phone, so is the 4a, and the rumored 4a5G. Getting confused? So am I. Google's smartphone strategy is getting confusing with no clear midrange and no clear flagship many, including me, are beginning to give up on Pixel.

  

The delays have been fatal for the 4a, many people have already gotten the smartphone they wanted and competitors like the iPhone SE and OnePlus Nord just destroying it at home and abroad. Google better fix Pixel. FAST. If not, Google hardware might be a dying breed. The Pixel 4a is actually not that bad and for the price it could be a special phone for some people.
