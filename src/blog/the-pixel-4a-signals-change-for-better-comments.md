Hey there! so I have to be honest the iPhone SE 2 is a completely different phone for completely different people. The SE 2 is more for those in the Apple ecosystem and the pure power for price is amazing. The SE has an ok camera so the 4a wins out there but other than that the SE and Nord can beat the 4a. The 4a is more a phone for the Android faithful and photographers than those just wanting a phone. It is cheaper so both have their strengths but I think the Nord and 4a is a better comparison because the iPhone faithful have almost no chance of switching to Android so the comparison might be wasted on most people.
