The Pixel 4a has finally been released into the hands of dozens of reviewers and bloggers (I wasn't one of them sadly) and results have been overwhelmingly positive.  I wrote an article right before the release and my position still stands, Google made a good phone way too late.  Despite its lateness the Pixel 4a might be a look into the future of Pixel, and of so that future was worth the wait.

So, I just want to look at the history of the pixel just for a bit, there have only been 2 Pixels that have never had a review scandal.  The OG Pixel 1 and the Pixel 3a.  The Pixels 2-4 have all had some sort of scandal, for the 2 it was the bezels and the screen issues on the XL version, the Pixel 3 had the Notch and battery life, and then the Pixel 4 had motion sense and battery life AGAIN.  These review scandals have cost the Pixel dearly in sales and in reputation.  The Pixel 4a has been received and hailed as one of the best Pixel's ever made and as one of the best midrange Android Phones on the market

. I have some thoughts about the 4a so let me get those out of the way first.  I will miss the squeeze feature, yeah Dieter bohn of the verge might not but the squeeze is the main way I call up google assistant on my phone.  If I could use that feature on every phone I would, I really hope this isn't the end of the line for squeeze, just know that you had fans buddy :(.  Also, the hole punch gives way more screen that both the notch and the forehead, I just wish it were in the center like Samsung and nature intended it to be. Last things last I do want to express my disappointment in there not being more than one camera on the 4a, triple and dual cameras have been the industry standard for a long time and I'm really sad to see no progress for Pixel. 

 Oh well, better to have an amazing main camera than to have 4 mediocre ones (looking at you Nord). I want to advocate for plastic backs, not seriously glass is precariously slippery and I frankly kind of hate it.  If you can get wireless charging through _good_ plastic GO FOR IT**!  **It lowers the cost and increases durability, and grip ability if that is even a word.  Nice to see battery life finally get as good as it should be, the flagship Pixel 4 had worse battery life than every phone surrounding it whereas the Pixel 4a can hang with most midranges in this territory.  Lat but not least the inclusion of a headphone jack; thank you Google how kind of you.  That fingerprint scanner is worth its weight in convenience in the age of Covid-19; it's also simply better than Face ID in terms of reliability for me.

Now let us talk about the effects of the 4a on the long-term of Pixel.  The rumors have all pointed to Google repositioning the Pixel turning it more into a Mid-range brand instead of a Flagship.  The "A" series has never disappointed us because we just did not expect much in the first place.  Flagships receive extreme scrutiny from reviewers and customers alike where the slightest nitpick is a point off the scorecard leading to an exceptionally low final tally.

 Midrange means that google can make the best of its class without the scrutiny and nitpicks flagships receive.  It means every phone can be as great as the "A" class phones we all just love so much.  This could be what Pixel Needs to get back into the game, the Camera has been the selling point for years but Samsung, Apple, and even OnePlus have caught up.  Having one of the best cameras in a Midrange price and package can help boost the midrange and allow those who want a flagship buy one from Samsung, Apple, OnePlus, and yeah LG.  Google never even came close to dominating anything in any hardware space except in smart homes.  Google can dominate the Mid-range and build a better name for themselves there than they ever could in the flagship space.
