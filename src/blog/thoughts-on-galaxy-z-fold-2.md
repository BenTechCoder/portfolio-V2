 So far the biggest win for the Fold 2 is that it hasn't broken 2 day's in, unlike its predecessor the original Fold it has managed to survive more than 3 days which is better than the 2 days that the other Fold managed to survive. 

  

  

Samsung has really improved the hinge and screen in two major ways, stronger hinge/brushes, and ultra-thin glass. The hinge is now strong enough to be able to stop at any point in the hinge, being able to open it up halfway and use it like two screens is both good and not good. It's better than nothing though, the ultra-thin glass however is a lot more interesting. Users have reported that the screen now feels a lot smoother thanks to the ultra-thin glass but you're not actually touching the ultra-thin glass. The layers your touching are the built-in screen protector (plastic) and the protective plastic layer under the screen protector. The screen is being heavily protected by two layers and that's because the ultra-thin glass still isn't strong enough to withstand most scratches and bumps our fingers due to our screens each day. 

  

  

  

The Fold 2 has another screen on the back that helps recoup usability while closed. There were huge bezels on the first-generation fold but now it's been replaced by a display with a hole-punch leaving way more room for apps. Users have reported that typing and other small actions are much better. 

  

  

  

The Fold 2 is launching in an age of new form-factors with the dual-screen Surface Duo and upcoming LG wing making waves in the tech world. The Fold 2 is a unique form-factor that can't be compared to any of these other phones. The Duo is Dual screened because of its focus on productivity but the Fold isn't for that. The Fold is a more consumer device, the bigger screens allows you to watch movies, read books, and just engage more with a single app. That is why the Fold cannot be compared with the Duo, and that price is reflecting of that too. With a price that can go above 2,000$ it's not for everyone and it's definitely a luxury device. I'll have to wait for more reviews to be able to comment more but for now the Fold 2 is a step in the right direction.
