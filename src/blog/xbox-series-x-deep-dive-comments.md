I'm pretty heavily invested in the Xbox ecosystem right now, especially because I own the Xbox One S LOL. Considering my current experiences (I'm working on a blog post about saying goodbye to the Xbox One series) with Xbox One S I would bite the bullet and get a PS4. I have to admit if I could start over and get any of the two consoles for free I would get a PS4. For now I'll stick with Xbox.
